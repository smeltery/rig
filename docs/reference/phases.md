# Named Phases

Named phases are focused prompts for one interactive turn. Rig ships with
`design`, `plan`, `build`, and `review`; users invoke them with slash commands:

```text
/review current branch
```

Ordinary prose never activates a phase. For example, `Run the review phase`
is sent to the model unchanged and does not receive the configured review
prompt or phase label.

The phase prompt is sent to the model with the user's arguments. The TUI shows
the phase name before normal workflow and tool activity, then leaves a concise
completion receipt. Phase state is not persisted and does not enforce an order
or replace the generic workflow checklist.

## Defaults

| Phase | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `design` | Ground a proposed product change, feature, or bug fix in the current system and define acceptance criteria. |
| `plan` | Break accepted work into small, ordered tasks with checks. |
| `build` | Implement, test, self-review, simplify, and verify a complete change. |
| `review` | Review and improve code, PR feedback, and CI results with fresh context. |

## Configuration

The `phases` map in `rig.yaml` adds a named prompt or overrides a default by
name. Names use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores. Native
commands such as `help`, `clear`, and `model` are reserved.

```yaml
phases:
  security:
    description: Review authentication and trust boundaries
    prompt: |
      Inspect the requested security boundary.
      Report and fix actionable findings, then rerun relevant checks.

  review:
    prompt: |
      Apply this project's review policy to the requested scope.
```

Configured fields overlay the matching default, so overriding only `prompt`
retains the built-in description. Additional phases appear after the four
defaults in the slash picker.

Named-phase slash commands take precedence over skills with the same name. A
same-named skill remains available through its `$name` reference.

## Boundaries

`internal/phase` owns definitions, default prompts, config overlay, slash
invocation expansion, and display labels. The TUI owns slash routing and the
active turn label. `internal/workflow` remains the only visible checklist model.
The core agent loop does not interpret phase names or transitions.

Full prompt bodies are injected only when invoked. The saved message keeps a
separate display value, so resume, session titles, and transcript search show
the user's `/review` invocation instead of the expanded prompt body.
