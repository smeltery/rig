# System Prompt

## The Simple Idea

The system prompt is the agent's instruction sheet. It tells the model what Rig is, what behavior to prefer, and what extra project context is available.

If the user message is the task, the system prompt is the job description.

## The Problem

A coding agent needs stable instructions, but it also needs local context. Some context is almost always the same, such as "prefer small verified changes." Other context changes by project, such as AGENTS.md files or available skills.

If all of that is mashed into one giant string, it is harder to understand, harder to cache, and harder to customize.

## How Rig Solves It

Rig builds the prompt in ordered blocks:

1. A stable base prompt plus the named-phase and skill catalogs.
2. Dynamic project instructions from AGENTS.md files.

The flattened prompt is still available for providers that only accept a string. Providers that support structured system prompts can use `llm.SystemBlock` values instead.

## What Goes Where

| Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Base prompt | Rig's default behavior: focused coding agent, read files, make small verified changes. |
| Named phase catalog | Names and descriptions of built-in and configured prompts. Full bodies are injected only when invoked. |
| Skill catalog | Names and descriptions of available skills. Full skill bodies are only expanded when invoked with `$name` or `/name args`. |
| AGENTS.md | Project or user instructions that should guide work in this repo. |

## How To Customize It

Use AGENTS.md for durable project instructions. For example:

```md
Read docs/reference/index.md before making changes.
Keep developer docs current when behavior changes.
Run go test ./... after Go changes.
```

Use skills for reusable workflows that should only apply when requested, such as review or commit behavior. Invoke a skill by mentioning `$name` in chat or by running `/name args` from the TUI.

Use named phases for low-friction, configurable prompts that should appear as
first-class slash commands and as the active TUI label. Phase names and
descriptions are always advertised, while their full bodies remain outside the
base prompt until invocation.

Change the base prompt only when the default personality or operating rules of Rig itself should change.

## What To Be Careful About

Always-loaded prompt text costs tokens every turn. Keep stable instructions short. Put big or optional workflows in skills, tools, or searchable history instead of stuffing them into the system prompt.

## Where To Look

- `cmd/rig/main.go`: chat startup and prompt assembly.
- `internal/projectctx`: AGENTS.md discovery and rendering.
- `internal/phase`: default and configured named prompts.
- `internal/skills`: skill catalog and expansion.
- `internal/llm/provider.go`: `SystemBlock`.
