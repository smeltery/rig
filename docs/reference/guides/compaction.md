# Compaction

## The Simple Idea

Compaction is how an agent keeps a long conversation small enough to fit in the model's context window.

If the transcript is a backpack, compaction is repacking it so the important things still fit.

## The Problem

Every model has a context limit. Long coding sessions can accumulate user messages, assistant messages, tool calls, tool results, diffs, test output, and screenshots.

If the transcript gets too large, the next provider call may fail or become wastefully expensive.

## How Rig Solves It Today

Rig summarizes old turns once the transcript gets large:

- `compact.Compactor` is the interface; the agent calls it before every provider call.
- `compact.Summarizer` is wired in by the chat command. When the estimated transcript size passes 70% of the configured context window, it asks the provider to summarize the oldest turns and replaces them with a single user message carrying the summary. The most recent messages are kept verbatim.
- `NoCompaction` is the fallback when no compactor is configured.
- `SafeSplitPoint` picks the cut so strategies avoid invalid transcript splits.

The important safety rule is: never keep a `tool_result` without its matching `tool_use`.

## Context Window Setting

Rig uses a conservative default context window of 200k tokens and compacts at 70% of that estimate. Users on larger-context models can raise it in `rig.yaml`:

```yaml
compaction:
  context_window_tokens: 1000000
```

Rig does not maintain a model catalog for compaction. Unknown or custom models use the same conservative default unless the user sets an override.

## Strategy Options

| Strategy | Idea | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No compaction | Keep the transcript as-is. | Fallback when unconfigured. |
| Summarize old turns | Replace older conversation with a summary. | Current default (`Summarizer`). |
| Sliding window | Keep only the most recent safe chunk. | Future. |
| Manual context-window override | Compact at 70% of `compaction.context_window_tokens`. | Current default path. |

## What Good Compaction Preserves

Good compaction keeps:

- the user's goal,
- decisions already made,
- files changed,
- commands run,
- unresolved errors,
- enough recent context for the model to continue.

It can drop:

- repeated logs,
- obsolete exploration,
- huge tool outputs once summarized,
- details that no longer affect the task.

## Where To Look

- `internal/compact/compact.go`: compactor interface and safe split helper.
- `internal/agent/agent.go`: compactor call before provider calls.
