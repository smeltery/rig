# Tools

Rig exposes a small built-in tool surface to the model.

| Tool | Surface | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent` | Interactive chat | Spawn a fresh subagent with a self-contained prompt. `mode: "work"` is writable and serial; `mode: "inspect"` is read-only and parallel-safe. |
| `bash` | Chat and headless | Run a shell command via `/bin/bash -c`. Returns bounded combined stdout and stderr, retaining the start and end when truncated. |
| `edit_file` | Chat and headless | Replace exactly one occurrence of `old_string` with `new_string`. Fails if the old text is missing or appears more than once. |
| `glob` | Chat and headless | Find files under the workspace root using a glob pattern. Supports `**` for recursive matches and returns structured JSON. |
| `grep` | Chat and headless | Search complete text lines up to 4 MiB under the workspace with a regular expression and return structured JSON matches. Longer lines return an explicit error. Very long match and context text is returned as a bounded excerpt. |
| `read_file` | Chat and headless | Read a file from disk. Returns up to about 256 KiB. Use `offset` and `limit` with 1-indexed line numbers to page through larger files. |
| `workflow` | Interactive chat | Create or update the visible workflow checklist. Rig attaches tool and subagent activity to the active item automatically. |
| `write_file` | Chat and headless | Write content to a file, creating parent directories. Overwrites the file if it exists. |

Independent inspect calls issued in one model response can run concurrently.
Inspect children receive only `read_file`, `grep`, and `glob`.

Recursive `grep` discovery and file reads use a rooted filesystem handle anchored
to the resolved workspace root. A discovered symlink that escapes that root is
rejected with an explicit error, including when an ordinary file is replaced by
an escaping symlink between discovery and reading. Relative and absolute
symlinks whose targets remain inside the workspace are searched under the link's
displayed path.

## Execution and confirmations

Rig relies on its VM or sandbox for security boundaries. Interactive users can
set `tool_approvals` to confirm exact tool names or Bash command prefixes. The
list is empty by default and is not applied to headless or child agents.
