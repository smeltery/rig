# Architecture

Rig is a small Go coding agent. The core agent loop is policy-free: it owns message state, calls an LLM provider, emits events, and runs injected tools. Product behavior is layered around that loop.

## Main Modules

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/rig/` | Process lifecycle, stream-injected command dispatch, and chat session startup. |
| `internal/agent/` | Core agent loop, transcript state, event model, tool-use continuation. |
| `internal/approval/` | Literal matcher for optional interactive tool confirmations. |
| `internal/atomicfile/` | Atomic file replacement used by session and credential storage. |
| `internal/auth/` | OpenAI ChatGPT/Codex device-code login, token refresh, and stored subscription credentials. |
| `internal/compact/` | Compaction interface, summarizing compactor, and safe split helpers. |
| `internal/config/` | Config discovery, defaults, and feature flags. |
| `internal/factory/` | Subagent runtime for the chat `agent` tool: supervisor budgets, node tree, and event stream. |
| `internal/llm/` | Provider-neutral request/response types and system prompt blocks. |
| `internal/llm/anthropic/` | Anthropic provider adapter. |
| `internal/llm/openai/` | OpenAI provider adapters for API-key Responses API calls and ChatGPT/Codex subscription calls. |
| `internal/llm/chatcompletions/` | Reusable OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions adapter. |
| `internal/llm/openrouter/` | OpenRouter provider setup and defaults. |
| `internal/llm/google/` | Google Gemini adapter. |
| `internal/logx/` | Optional structured debug logging. |
| `internal/phase/` | Built-in and configured named prompts, slash invocation expansion, and display labels. |
| `internal/projectctx/` | AGENTS.md discovery and prompt augmentation. |
| `internal/session/` | File-backed session metadata and transcripts. |
| `internal/skills/` | Skill discovery, catalog rendering, and $name or /name expansion. |
| `internal/tools/` | Built-in tools exposed to the model. |
| `internal/tui/` | Bubble Tea terminal UI and transcript rendering. |
| `internal/workflow/` | In-memory checklist state and the chat `workflow` tool. |
| `internal/workspace/` | Workspace helpers shared by project-context features. |

## Chat Startup Flow

1. `cmd/rig` resolves the session store. For a resumed chat, it loads the session and restores its saved working directory before entering the shared chat path.
2. It loads config and selects Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Google Gemini, preferring saved provider and model metadata when resuming. OpenAI defaults to API-key auth; `openai_auth: subscription` builds the Codex subscription provider from stored device-code credentials.
3. It resolves the project root, constructs the workflow and subagent capabilities, and builds the complete tool registry.
4. For a new chat, it creates the session in `internal/session`.
5. Named phases, skills, and AGENTS.md are loaded, then `chatSystem` builds both flattened and segmented system prompts.
6. `agent.New` receives the provider, tools, optional interactive approval matcher, system prompt, and restored messages and usage.
7. `tui.Run` owns user interaction and saves the transcript after each send.

## Execution Boundary

Rig assumes its VM or sandbox controls filesystem, process, network, credential,
and external-service access. Rig does not classify commands or enforce a
security policy. Interactive `tool_approvals` add optional confirmation before
selected coordinator calls; they are not passed to headless or child agents.

Inspect children are constrained by capability selection: their registry
contains only `read_file`, `grep`, and `glob`.

## Agent Loop Contract

The agent appends one user text message per `Send` call. Before each provider
turn, the compactor may make its own provider call and returns both the rewritten
transcript and that call's usage. The agent aggregates compaction and normal
response usage exactly once. Each normal provider response becomes an assistant
message. If the assistant requests tools, Rig runs them, caps oversized output
before it enters user `tool_result` blocks, and continues the provider loop until
the assistant ends the turn or max turns is reached. A provider refusal ends the
turn with its refusal text unless accepted steering requests a continuation,
while `pause_turn` explicitly replays the assistant response and continues.
Unknown stop reasons fail the turn instead of repeating provider calls.
Anthropic's `model_context_window_exceeded` ends the turn with a typed truncation
error and preserves any partial response text.
